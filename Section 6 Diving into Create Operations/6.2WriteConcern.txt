// write concern
by default it is 1,
w: write =>How many instances you want this write to be acknowledged
j:journal=>additional file the storage engine manages which is like a TODO file,
to save operations the storage engine needs to do like storing data
It gives nice backup
Why do we write on journal, why not on the database directly?
Its because the writing to database is performance heavy job.
j:true means please only report a sucess write to me after it has been
both acknowledged and saved in the database
wtimeout:which timeframe do you give your server to report sucess for this write before it fails.
if we set very low wtimeout,it ll fail even though there is no problem 
due to less time to fulfill the operation

example:db.persons.insertOne({name:"Pradeep Dai",age:35},{writeConcern:{w:0,j:false,wtimeout:200}})

wtimeout:just to not wait unnecessarily long
