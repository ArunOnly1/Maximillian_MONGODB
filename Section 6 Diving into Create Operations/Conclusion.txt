insertOne and insertMany is recommended 
but insert is not recommended as it also does not return inserted inserted

//Ordererd inserts {ordered:true}
By default while using insertMany(),inserts are ordered 
- that means the inserting process stops if an error occurs

//Unorderd insert {ordered:false}
=>inserting process will continue even if the error occurs

I=>n both ordered and unordered inserts, no successful inserts(before the error) will be rolled back

//Write Concern
=>Data should be stored and you can control the 'level of guarantee' of that to happen
with the writeConcern option
=>Choose the option value based on the app requirement
